        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Philippine adobo is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process in Philippine cuisine of,<br> 
            in its base form, meat, seafood, or vegetables first browned in oil, and then marinated <br>
            and simmered vinegar, salt and/or soy sauce, and garlic. It has occasionally been considered <br>
            the unofficial national dish in the Philippines.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Dried Bay Leaves</li>
            <li>Whole Peppercorn</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing to do is marinate the pork belly in soy sauce and crushed garlic. <br>
                It is best to marinate it overnight. If time is limited, one hour should be enough. <br>
                Some like to add vinegar during the process. You may do so if preferred.</li>
            <li>Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated pork needs to be browned. <br>
                Heat a cooking pot. Add pork with garlic. You can also add a few tablespoons of cooking oil. <br>
                Cook the pork until it turns brown.</li>
            <li>Cook the pork until tender. Do this by pouring the remaining marinade, if any. Also add water. <br>
                Let the liquid boil. <br> 
                <br>
                This is the part where we put the whole peppercorn and dried bay leaves. <br>
                These ingredients complete the pork adobo. Boiling for 40 minutes should <br>
                be enough to tenderize the pork. There are times when you have to cook longer.</li>
            <li>If you have not added the vinegar as part of the marinade, pour it into the pot and <br>
                let it cook for 10 minutes. Salt is an optional ingredient for this recipe. Use it <br>
                only if you think it is needed.</li>
            <li>Taste the sauce first so that you know what seasonings to add. Since we already added <br>
                a good amount of soy sauce, salt might not be needed. However, this depends on your preference. <br>
                You can also add more water here if you think that then saltiness is on the upper side. <br>
                Sometimes we can also add a dash of sugar to balance the flavor.</li>
        </ol>
